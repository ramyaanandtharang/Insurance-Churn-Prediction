# Insurance-Churn-Prediction

Insurance companies around the world operate in a very competitive environment. 
With various aspects of data collected from millions of customers, 
it is painstakingly hard to analyze and understand the reason for a customerâ€™s decision to switch to a different insurance provider.

For an industry where customer acquisition and retention are equally important,
and the former being a more expensive process, insurance companies rely on data to understand customer behaviour to prevent retention.
Thus knowing whether a customer is possibly going to switch beforehand gives Insurance companies an opportunity to
come up with strategies to prevent it from actually happening.

Given are 16 distinguishing factors that can help in understanding the customer churn, 
our objective as a data scientist is to build a Machine Learning model that can predict whether the insurance
company will lose a customer or not using these factors.
